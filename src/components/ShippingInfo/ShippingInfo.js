            <p className='text-sm text-gray-500 leading-6 tracking-wide font-sans'>
                When it comes to shipping furniture or anything else, there is always shipping fee involved. Whether the customer pays or the dealer it has to be paid to transport one way or another. To appreciate your business, for larger online orders we offer Free shipping for local GTA areas. This is purely an expanse we incur to value our customers business.
            </p><br />
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-500 leading-6 tracking-wide font-sans'>
                Some well-known online retailers are way unfair and hide shipping fees in prices and then claim it as “Free shipping” .  At Berkshire Furniture we truly give you Free shipping to local area out of our pocket. We do not add this fee to orders which qualify for free shipping and that is why we can only do so for certain volume orders and only for GTA (Greater Toronto Area) deliveries.
            </p><br />
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-500 leading-6 tracking-wide font-sans'>
                For other areas and long distance addresses, we try to get you the most affordable shipping fee to bring your order to you. We also make sure that we include the insurance for the furniture just in case something unexpected happen to your furniture.

                USA Shipping:
            </p>
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-500 leading-6 tracking-wide font-sans'>
                We do ship to US and it is all done by standard shipping. We have no means of white glove shipping to US states. The only way White Glove would be possible is for us to arrange a Delivery Company within your area, have the transport company deliver the furniture to a storage facility, then their guys would come and install in your home. Keep in mind this would mean two separate shipping charges, 1 for the Transport company bringing the furniture, and the other for the delivery company to install it in your home. Please call our store and speak with a Sales Person to get more information.
